T
he Supreme Court
on Friday asked
the State Bank of
India (SBI) why it had not
disclosed the unique alphanumeric numbers of
individual electoral bonds
to the Election Commission (EC) for publication
on its ocial website.
“In our judgment of February 15, we had directed
disclosure specically of all
the details of the electoral
bonds, including date of
their purchase, the
amount, names of purchasers, the political parties which redeemed the
bonds, etc. But the bank
has not disclosed the numbers of the bonds purchased and encashed.
Why?” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud,
heading a ve-judge
Bench, asked.
The court issued a notice to the bank and listed
the case for March 19.
The Bench further
agreed to return to the EC
the documents regarding
electoral bonds which the
poll body had given the
court, in compliance with
judicial orders passed on
April 12, 2019 and November 2, 2023.
‘No copies retained’ 
In its judgment on February 15, the ve-judge Bench
had directed the EC to publish the condential information submitted in the
court, along with details of
electoral bonds. However,
the EC led an application
on March 14, saying that it
had given the court the originals of the documents
and not retained any
copies.
The Commission said
that it had handed over to
vember 2023.
“We presumed you
would have retained copies,” Chief Justice Chandrachud told advocate
Amit Sharma, appearing
for the EC.
The court ordered its
digitised copy, provided by
the Supreme Court itself,
will help avert any delay in
the publication of these
documents on electoral
bonds.
The court, in its February 15 judgment, had required the SBI to provide
the EC with the complete
details, including dates of
purchase; the names of the
purchasers; and the denominations of the bonds
purchased; along with the
details of bonds redeemed
by political parties, including their dates of encashment and denominations.
The SBI had said that
22,217 electoral bonds
were purchased and
22,030 were redeemed by
political parties between
April 1, 2019 and February
15, 2024.
